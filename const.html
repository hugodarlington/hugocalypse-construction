          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            We are a building company based in the beautiful Holme Valley near
            Holmfirth in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. <br /><br />

            Proud of our roots, we try to be very Yorkshire like in the way we
            go about our business. Friendly, honest, sticklers for good value
            and with an appreciation for how stunning the Huddersfield
            countryside is. As a business, we would like to contribute to that
            beauty by creating amazing buildings constructed with great
            craftsmanship. <br /><br />

            Having a wealth of experience in building and construction
            management, we can tackle small extensions to large new build
            projects. We are happy working with both traditional building
            materials and new construction methods. The quality of our
            workmanship and customer service is without compromise. In
            addition to our in-house skills, we have a network of first-rate
            contractors and professionals. If required, we can provide you
            with assistance with architects, planning, structural engineers,
            costings and project management. <br /><br />

            You’ll find us easy to work with, honest, proactive in our
            approach and forthcoming with information. Together we’ll create a
            finished building to be proud of.
